Course requirements and sample schedules can be found in the Computer Engineering section of the current bulletin, and more details about the technical elective requirement can be found in the Computer Engineering curriculum checklist (PDF). Additional references that might be useful include a course flowchart that shows the sequencing constraints for the major-specific courses, and a one-page handout (PDF) about the program.
This undergraduate program incorporates most of the core curricula in both electrical engineering and computer science so that students will be well prepared to work in the area of computer engineering, which substantially overlaps both fields. Both hardware and software aspects of computer science are included, and, in electrical engineering, students receive a solid grounding in circuit theory and in electronic circuits. The program includes several electrical engineering laboratory courses as well as the Computer Science Department’s advanced programming course.
Students will be prepared to work on all aspects of the design of digital hardware, as well as on the associated software that is now often an integral part of computer architecture. They will also be well equipped to work in the growing field of telecommunications. Students will have the prerequisites to delve more deeply into either hardware or software areas, and enter graduate programs in computer science, electrical engineering, or computer engineering. For example, they could take more advanced courses in VLSI, communications theory, computer architecture, electronic circuit theory, software engineering, or digital design.
