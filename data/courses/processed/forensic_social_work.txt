TITLE: FORENSIC SOCIAL WORK
SUBJECT: Social Work
INSTRUCTOR: Rachelle Williams
DESCRIPTION: This course introduces students to the field of social work and the law – specifically the practice of social work in legal settings.  Students will develop competency in forensic social work practice - working knowledge as a practitioner in an interdisciplinary setting representing clients entangled in legal systems including criminal, civil, family and immigration.  Students will deconstruct the complexities of the criminal legal systems and further develop awareness in addressing clients’ concerns related to their criminal justice history – pre-arrest, arrest, disposition and re-entry. Similarly, students will gain insight into the filing of Article X petitions in family court and the pathway of a child protection case.  This course complements field placements in legal/forensic settings, law minors and students interested in social work and law rooted in rights-based advocacy. This course is premised on a basic understanding of how the legacy of slavery led to mass criminalization and incarceration.  Black Lives Matter.
