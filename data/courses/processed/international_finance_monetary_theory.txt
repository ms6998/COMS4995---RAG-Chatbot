TITLE: International Finance & Monetary Theory
SUBJECT: Intl Finance & Economic Policy
INSTRUCTOR: 
DESCRIPTION: This is a theory and applications course in international macroeconomics and finance. It provides students with the basic tools to analyze real-life macroeconomic, policy, and financial market situations. The class is suitable for those interested in working at domestic or international policy institutions, in diplomatic service, the financial sector, or the media. Lectures are fairly rigorous, though if the student has some first-year economics, knows basic algebra and graphs, they will handle the material fairly easily. While theory is central, policy and market relevance is emphasized through: i) discussions on topical issues; ii) study of key historical and current episodes to illustrate ideas; iii) relevant pieces of policy/media/finance sector analysis. In terms of topics, part one will develop analytic frameworks to understand exchange rates in terms of short- and long-term determinants. Part two explores the balance of payments and the interaction between the macroeconomic policy, the exchange rate, and macroeconomic outcomes. Then part three will cover various advanced topics such as the choice of exchange rate regime, the euro, currency crashes, and default.
