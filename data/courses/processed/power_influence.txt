TITLE: Power & Influence
SUBJECT: Management
INSTRUCTOR: Mabel Abraham
DESCRIPTION: Power and influence processes are pervasive and important in organizations, so leaders need to be able both to understand power and to act on that knowledge. Organizations are fundamentally political entities, and power and influence are key mechanisms by which things get done. Therefore, this course has three objectives: 1) to increase students' ability to diagnose and analyze power; 2) to expose students to effective and appropriate methods of influence; and 3) to explain how power and influence can be used to build cooperation and promote change in organizations.
