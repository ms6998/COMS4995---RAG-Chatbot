TITLE: Management and Leadership Skills for Sci
SUBJECT: Neurobiology And Behavior
INSTRUCTOR: Ai Yamamoto
DESCRIPTION: This course will form part of the continuing series on the development of professional skills. It is aimed at introducing the class to leadership and management skills that are as much a part of professional growth and success as technical ability. The primary focus will be on learning to recognize common lab situations that can quickly become problematic if not skillfully handled, and knowing the self-management and interpersonal skills that need to be developed in order to navigate such situations. In addition to this primary focus, there will be discussions on how these skills are transferable to many different types of work and life (the skills are applicable not just in academia).
