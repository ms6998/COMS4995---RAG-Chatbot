TITLE: Energy, Corporate Responsibility, and Hu
SUBJECT: Regional Institute
INSTRUCTOR: Jenik R Radon
DESCRIPTION: This interdisciplinary seminar examines the role of multinational energy companies in the context of international human rights, corporate responsibility, and global governance. Drawing on case studies and legal frameworks, the course explores how extractive industries intersect with political, environmental, and social systems, particularly in transitional and emerging economies. Key themes include the development of international human rights law, the evolving definition of corporate responsibility, environmental and minority rights, corruption and transparency, and the geopolitics of natural resource extraction. Students will investigate how transnational corporations operate in weak governance zones, how investment treaties shape state-corporate relations, and how disputes over pipelines and land use affect communities and nations alike. The course emphasizes real-world case analysis, including the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, Canadian mining projects in Latin America, and recent developments in sovereign debt, investor-state arbitration, and standards for corporate conduct. Students will also evaluate the effectiveness of voluntary standards, multilateral codes, and legal instruments in shaping corporate behavior.
