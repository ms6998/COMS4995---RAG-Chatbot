TITLE: FIRST-YEAR WRITING AT BARNARD
SUBJECT: First-year Seminar
INSTRUCTOR: Duygu Ula
DESCRIPTION: First-Year Writing (FYW) courses invite students into the vibrant scholarly life of the college. Working in small, discussion-based seminar classes over the course of one semester, we read challenging literary texts and critical scholarship, helping students to develop fundamental skills in analysis and academic writing that allow them to take their place in vitally important scholarly conversations. Students may choose from a variety of special topics that focus on a particular literary tradition, theme, or phenomenon.
