SUBJECT: Film
INSTRUCTOR: Julia L Thompson
DESCRIPTION: Podcasts are an opportunity for writers and creative producers to showcase their talents in new ways and in an easily producible format. This course is a hands-on workshop in which students will learn the basics of every aspect of narrative podcasting (fiction and non-fiction) including topic research, market research, pitch writing, script writing, audio interviewing techniques, workflow and organization. By analyzing a case study podcast, the students will study story structure and pitch decks for scripted and non-scripted podcasts. After learning how to construct episodes, each student will record, edit and mix their episode. Students will leave this class understanding the mechanics of audio storytelling and with one proof-of-concept episode in their desired form.
