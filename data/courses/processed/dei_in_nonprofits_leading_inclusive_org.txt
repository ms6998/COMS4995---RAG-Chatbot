TITLE: DEI in Nonprofits: Leading Inclusive Org
SUBJECT: Nonprofit Management
INSTRUCTOR: Erwin Vincent S De Leon
DESCRIPTION: Apart from its justice and equity imperative, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) has become an operational imperative as organizations become increasingly diverse. This course aims to equip students with critical faculties and practical tools to be informed and ethical practitioners of DEI in the charitable sector. This course prepares students to manage and lead the practice of DEI in core operational functions, as directors of DEI offices/initiatives or as DEI champions within their organizations. It will equip students with an understanding of the advantages and challenges of leading diverse teams and will provide the knowledge, critical analysis, and practical tools required to lead inclusive organizations. It provides a framework and strategic foundation for driving an organization through the stages of gaining awareness about DEI, practicing DEI, and amplifying the work of equity and inclusion beyond the workplace.
