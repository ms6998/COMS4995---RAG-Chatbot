TITLE: AFRICAN DANCE I
SUBJECT: Dance
INSTRUCTOR: Maguette Camara
DESCRIPTION: In West Africa, dance is part of daily life. It is used to mark occasions such a birth, death, harvest, and  marriage. It is also used to unite the community in times of crisis. West African dance is not as much a strict  technique as it is a movement coming from the spirit and the rhythm of the drum and the energy of the  people. While there are certain steps that go with specific rhythms, it leaves space for the individual  interpretation and improvisations which is an important element. Dancing is more about the communication  between dancer and drummer. The movement of West African dance tends to be energetic and big. It is very  expressive, and the energy is outward. Some African dance steps are taken directly from daily activities such as planting or hunting. Most, however,  are an expression of joy or release of the spirit. Dancing is done by communicating with a drummer to create  positive energy. It is a way to enjoy oneself and each other. In African dance, the name of the dance is the  same as the name of the rhythm played by the drummer. The individual steps that make up the dance do not  have names. In this course, we are going to be learning various West African dances such as Sikko, Socco,  Kuku, Mandiany, Farakorroba, Sunu, Soli, Lamba, Mandjo, Diambadong, Doundounba, Kaolask,  Thieboudjeune, Niarry---gorong, Ekongkong, Wolossodong, Zaouly, Ngorong, Niakka, Maraka, Djansa and  Lengeng/Kutiro.
