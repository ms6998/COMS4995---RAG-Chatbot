TITLE: AI INFUSION
SUBJECT: Strategic Communication
INSTRUCTOR: Brandy N Dawson
DESCRIPTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is swiftly infusing the communication discipline with immediate implications for students and practitioners alike. To stay current with rapidly unfolding developments and create new ties with industry, this 0-credit course presents a biweekly series of speakers and panels comprised of alumni, Advisory Board members, and professionals. Speakers discuss their own AI use in the workplace. Students have the opportunity to interact with communication leaders on the forefront of AI implementation. Each session aligns with a different Strategic Communication course topic. Among the areas to be explored are synthetic data and synthetic audience testing, event simulation, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), agentic AI, content production, and personalization at scale. Along with current use cases, a core focus of discussion will be AI governance, leadership strategy and decision-making, workforce training, and the development of principles and policies to guide human-centric and ethical AI implementation.
