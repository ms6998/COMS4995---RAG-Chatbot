TITLE: ORGANIC CHEM. LAB II SYNTHESIS
SUBJECT: Chemistry
INSTRUCTOR: Talha Siddiqui
DESCRIPTION: Prerequisites: CHEM W1403-CHEM W1404; CHEM W1500; CHEM W2493. Corequisites: CHEM W2444. Please note that you must complete CHEM W2493 before you register for CHEM W2494. This lab introduces students to experimental design and trains students in the execution and evaluation of scientific data. The technique experiments in the first half of the course (CHEM W2493) teach students to develop and master the required experimental skills to perform the challenging synthesis experiments in the second semester. The learning outcomes for this lab are the knowledge and experimental skills associated with the most important synthetic routes widely used in industrial and research environments. Attendance at the first lab lecture and laboratory session is mandatory. Please note that CHEM W2494 is the second part of a full year organic chemistry laboratory course. Students must register for the lab lecture section (CHEM W2496) which corresponds to their lab section. Students must attend ONE lab lecture and ONE lab section every other week. Please contact your advisors for further information.
