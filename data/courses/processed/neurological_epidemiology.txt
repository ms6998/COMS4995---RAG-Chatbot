TITLE: Neurological Epidemiology
SUBJECT: Epidemiology
INSTRUCTOR: Sarah Tom
DESCRIPTION: Neurological disease epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of these diseases in human populations; it poses a set of novel challenges given the complex nature of the underlying organ. What are these challenges and what issues set this branch of epidemiology apart from others? The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the core principles of neuroepidemiology. The class will be strongly grounded in clinical neurology.  Highlighted are a number of diverse disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and epilepsy, many of which are exclusive to humans.  The epidemiology of these disorders will be the focus of a series of lectures. During the semester, we will also explore disease clusters, socio-medical aspects of these diseases, and interventional studies that attempt to alter their course. This elective course in the Department of Epidemiology is intended for MS and MPH students. In the past, we have had a mixed audience of graduate students in epidemiology and other departments in the Mailman School of Public Health as well as medical students and physicians who are pursuing epidemiological training. This blend of students leads to a rich and varied discussion. Our overarching goal is to open a world for students, expose them to a new body of knowledge, and get them to think about a series of thorny epidemiological issues. More specifically, students will gain a thorough understanding of the normal and abnormal workings of the brain and be able to identify and explain how the clinical expression of the latter creates an interesting and often distinctive set of challenges for epidemiologists as they attempt to screen for, diagnose and study the determinants of these uniquely human diseases.
