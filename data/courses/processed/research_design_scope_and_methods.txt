TITLE: RESEARCH DESIGN: SCOPE AND METHODS
SUBJECT: Political Science
INSTRUCTOR: Caterina Chiopris
DESCRIPTION: This class aims to introduce students to the logic of social scientific inquiry and research design. Although it is a course in political science, our emphasis will be on the science part rather than the political part — we’ll be reading about interesting substantive topics, but only insofar as they can teach us something about ways we can do systematic research. This class will introduce students to a medley of different methods to conduct social scientific research.
