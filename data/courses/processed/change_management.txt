TITLE: CHANGE MANAGEMENT
SUBJECT: Human Capital Management
INSTRUCTOR: Solange Charas
DESCRIPTION: Change is a necessary and constant part of any organization. The change may be expected, or it may be in reaction to unanticipated external and/or internal factors. In fact, organizations that do not change do not last. Change initiatives can be exceedingly complex and disorienting, however. The success of a given changeinitiative often rests on the clarity of vision of an organization’s leaders; an accurate and sensitiveunderstanding of the organization’s culture; the involvement, input and buy-in of multiple internal andexternal stakeholders to the change objectives and process; leaders’ ability to leverage technology tocommunicate and drive change; and an organization’s analytical capabilities to document and measureprogress, and continue to iterate and improve. In light of these requirements, this course seeks to ask: What is the role of the HCM leader in facilitatingchange within an organization? The aims of this course are not abstract. This course will help studentsdevelop skills to support actual organizations (their own and/or others) through change. Lectures, readings,videos, in-class and asynchronous discussions, and assignments will all focus on the practical application ofchange theory and empirical research to real-world organizational contexts. This course is an advanced elective within the Master of Science in Human Capital Management program.Prerequisites include “HCMPS5100: Introduction to Human Capital Management,” and “HCMPS5150:Integrated Talent Management Strategies.” Some familiarity with people analytics and digital approaches toHuman Capital Management will also be helpful.
