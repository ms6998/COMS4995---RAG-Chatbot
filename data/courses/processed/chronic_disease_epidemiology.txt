TITLE: Chronic Disease Epidemiology
SUBJECT: Epidemiology
INSTRUCTOR: Nour Makarem
DESCRIPTION: This course has several goals.  The first is to delineate a “personality” for chronic diseases (CDs).  CDs are not extensions in time of acute illness.  CDs most often have long, latent, asymptomatic beginnings, often attributable to risk factors, themselves often modifiable; interventions are usually designed for amelioration and management rather than treatment and cure   As these diseases emerge in complex contexts with upstream triggers that are embedded in social, political, and economic realms, successful management requires an understanding of these drivers. The second goal is to enlarge the visual field of the public health student to see these diseases in their global settings.  It is now widely recognized that these same chronic diseases—heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes, and cancer—are emerging as the dominant health issues for all countries on all continents.  Hence, the course will cover these disorders in both developed and developing countries. The third goal is to present the complexity of interventions.  Prevention, or management, requires interventions that intersect personal, national and global behavior, and equally important, cultural patterns, and political realities.  Effective intervention requires exploration of the impact of urbanization and globalization. Creating actionable plans requires input from a wide array of disciplines including, but is not limited to, anthropology, urban planning, political science, trade policy, corporate policy, information technology, advertising, and lobbying.  This course is designed to tie these factors together in a focused manner that will permit the student to grasp the breadth of the problems and appreciate the new public health roles epidemiology will need to play to combat this modern epidemic.
