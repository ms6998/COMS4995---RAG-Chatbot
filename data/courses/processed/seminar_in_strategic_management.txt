TITLE: Seminar in Strategic Management
SUBJECT: Public Health
INSTRUCTOR: 
DESCRIPTION: The Course considers questions of Mission and Vision ("What areas, activities, or business(es) should we be in?") and questions of Strategy and Operations ("How can we perform or compete effectively in this area?"). It covers both strategy formulation ("What should our strategy be?") as well as strategy implementation ("What do we need to do to make this strategy work?"). The Course also addresses additional issues that are critical to the strategic management "process" (e.g. designing planning systems, managing contention, analyzing market context) are considered. We will build the foundation based on “macro” theories of strategic management (i.e., theories focused on organization and firm level decisions).
