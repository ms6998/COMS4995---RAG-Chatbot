TITLE: Epidemiologic Theory and Methods in Sexu
SUBJECT: Epidemiology
INSTRUCTOR: Dustin T Duncan
DESCRIPTION: This course will provide an introduction to the existing research on sexual and gender minority (SGM) health with a specific emphasis on epidemiologic theory and methods. Through readings and group discussions we will cover issues related to the design of epidemiologic studies that focus on different sexual and gender minority populations (e.g., queer cisgender populations and transgender and non-binary populations). In addition the course will review the sexual and gender minority health literature as it pertains to group differences (e.g., race, socioeconomic status), using intersectionality as a conceptual and methodological framework. Lectures will include both content- and methods-focused components. Substantive topics of focus include social determinants of health and specific health outcomes and health behaviors, such as HIV, substance use and mental health burdens. Methodological issues that are particularly challenging in sexual and gender minority health will be discussed, including sampling sexual and gender minority populations, causal inference methods in sexual and gender minority health research, and analytical approaches in epidemiologic studies of sexual and gender minority populations. This course provides students with the opportunity to apply epidemiologic principles and methods and develop foundational skills necessary to critically evaluate the existing sexual and gender minority health research literature. This course fulfills an elective requirement for the Social Determinants of Health certificate. Participation in class discussion, experiential learning activities, and a final paper will be used to evaluate progress towards learning objectives.
