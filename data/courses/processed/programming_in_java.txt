TITLE: PROGRAMMING IN JAVA
SUBJECT: Prof. Studies Management
INSTRUCTOR: Feyzi Bagirov
DESCRIPTION: Java is a versatile and powerful programming language widely used to build scalable, secure, and reusable applications. It is invaluable for processing large datasets, automating data workflows, and integrating analytical models with enterprise systems. Java’s extensive libraries and frameworks, combined with platform independence, make it an essential tool for creating robust data-driven solutions. From building data pipelines to creating APIs that connect analytical models to operational systems, Java equips students with the skills needed to tackle real-world analytical challenges. This elective course introduces graduate students to Java programming with the overall goal of technical fluency in the programming language. Through a practical and application-focused approach, students will learn to write, compile, and execute Java programs while mastering foundational programming concepts. Key topics include object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, Java's role in modern software development, and the essential tools, libraries, and frameworks. The course emphasizes developing problem-solving skills through hands-on programming assignments. It blends conceptual learning with practical experience in one of the most widely used programming languages in enterprise software development.
