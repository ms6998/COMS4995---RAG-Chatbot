TITLE: Quantitative Techniques
SUBJECT: Executive Mpa Program
INSTRUCTOR: Stuart E Ward
DESCRIPTION: This course equips mid-career professionals with the statistical tools needed to make data-informed decisions in public management and policy contexts. The course begins with foundational concepts in probability and statistics and advances through hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and applied data interpretation. Emphasis is placed on practical application, allowing students to critically evaluate research and apply quantitative findings to real-world policy and business challenges. Designed for students with basic mathematics and high school algebra, the course does not require prior statistical knowledge. It includes hands-on training in STATA, a widely used statistical software package, to streamline analysis and enhance decision-making capabilities. By the end of the semester, students will be prepared to use statistical reasoning in managerial settings and interpret quantitative analysis produced by professional researchers.
