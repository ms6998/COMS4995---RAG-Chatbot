TITLE: AT THE NEW YORKER
SUBJECT: Writing
INSTRUCTOR: Mark Rozzo
DESCRIPTION: In this seminar we will consider the history, legacy, and ongoing cultural contribution of The New Yorker , a magazine that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. During the past century, the magazine has been the primary venue for what we might call the “the literature of fact”—nonfiction writing with belletristic flair and high ambition across all genres: profiles, essays, personal histories, reporting, and criticism. We will read across the genres as we ask questions about these various nonfiction forms: Can criticism be the equal of art? How do nonfiction writers establish “authority”? How do they investigate the past and make sense of the new? How do they create work as rich and challenging as the best literary novels and short stories? What roles do voice, point-of-view, character, dialogue, and plot—the traditional elements of fiction—play? How did T he New Yorker create a—perhaps even the —modern American literary style? Week to week, since 1925, the magazine has showcased work from a staggering diversity of contributors. We will consider many of them, including James Thurber, Janet Flanner, E.B. White, Wolcott Gibbs, Joseph Mitchell, Lillian Ross, John Hersey, Edmund Wilson, Rachel Carson, James Baldwin, Hannah Arendt, Calvin Tomkins, Renata Adler, Pauline Kael, Kenneth Tynan, Mark Singer, Ian Frazier, Arlene Croce, Janet Malcolm, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Robert Caro, Tony Horowitz, Zadie Smith, and Susan Orlean. In addition, we will be keeping our eye on issues of The New Yorker as they roll out each week. We will welcome guest speakers from the magazine—editors and contributors, from past and present.
