TITLE: Digital Content Provenance: Path to Tran
SUBJECT: Technology Policy & Innovation
INSTRUCTOR: Mounir E Ibrahim
DESCRIPTION: This course explores one of the most promising responses to the risks posed by Generative AI: digital content provenance. As AI-generated media grows more sophisticated and accessible, questions of transparency and authenticity have become central to the global informational ecosystem. Digital content provenance—an emerging open standard supported by thousands of organizations and recognized in recent policy actions such as the White House Executive Order on AI—offers a potential path to restoring trust in what we see and hear online. Students will examine the technical foundations of provenance, including concepts such as public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities, and learn how provenance is being implemented across sectors including government, media, and technology. The course features guest speakers from industry and public service, providing insight into the policy, legal, and operational dimensions of this fast-evolving field. Through research, writing, and the creation of an original provenance-enabled project, students will develop a strong understanding of how digital content provenance works and its relevance to future regulatory frameworks. This course is designed for those interested in the intersection of AI, digital media, global policy, and emerging technology standards.
