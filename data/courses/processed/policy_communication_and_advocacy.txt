TITLE: Policy Communication and Advocacy
SUBJECT: School Of Int & Public Affairs
INSTRUCTOR: Kimberly Johnson
DESCRIPTION: MIA and MPA Policy Skills I Core. This course provides students with practical skills to communicate clearly and persuasively on issues they care about. Whether writing to influence policy, shape public opinion, or present ideas within an organization, the ability to craft sharp, purposeful messages is essential. Students will learn to distill their key arguments, adapt their writing for different audiences, and develop strong foundational pieces such as op-eds, press releases, and policy memos. The course also introduces generative AI tools as part of the writing process—teaching students how to use AI to brainstorm, draft, and revise more efficiently, while critically assessing its outputs. As AI transforms how we write and communicate, this course equips students to harness its benefits while maintaining their own voice, judgment, and clarity of thought.
