TITLE: Protect the Dolls: Trans Panics and Quee
SUBJECT: American Studies
INSTRUCTOR: Dani Joslyn
DESCRIPTION: Life as a trans person can feel like an unrelenting cacophony of hammers. Around the world, fascist parties and paramilitaries have set their sights on transgender people and through a torrent of accusations of crime and depravity all but authorized violence against trans people. Through explorations of trans* history and social movements in the United States, Turkey, India, and Pakistan (and to a lesser extent Argentina), this course will provide a space to both understand the global anti-gender and anti-trans panic and to relate ourselves to the strategies that trans people have used to both survive and the demands that they have made for structural change and liberation. The goal of this course will be to provide a space of critical study and a site of learning to be in community as well as to equip you with both the knowledge and capacity to understand and intervene in contemporary trans panics wherever you encounter them. Assignments will be a combination of collaborative skill-building, self-reflections, and analyses of the tactics and strategies employed by social movements.
