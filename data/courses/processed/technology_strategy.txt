Finally, in our third module, "Technology Strategy and Society", we will interact with guest speakers to discuss how technological change impacts social organization, and how businesses might use these opportunities to create and capture value.Specific topics and questions include but are not limited to the following: - How do firms leverage network effects to build sustainable competitive advantage? What are the optimal strategies for building multi-sided platforms? How should an incumbent firm respond to "disruptive" innovations? How can firms commercialize and protect new innovations or scientific discoveries? How do new technologies change the way we interact, and how should businesses respond?
