TITLE: HUMAN ADAPTATION
SUBJECT: Ecology,evolution & Envir Biol
INSTRUCTOR: Volney K Friedrich
DESCRIPTION: This course explores human adaptation from a biological, ecological and evolutionary perspective. From our earliest hominin ancestors in Africa to our own species' subsequent dispersal throughout the world, our lineage has encountered innumerable environmental pressures. Using morphological, physiological and behavioral/cultural evidence, we will examine the responses to these pressures that helped shape our unique lineage and allowed it to adapt to a diverse array of environments.
