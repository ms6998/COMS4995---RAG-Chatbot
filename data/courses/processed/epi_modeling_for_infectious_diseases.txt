TITLE: Epi Modeling for Infectious Diseases
SUBJECT: Epidemiology
INSTRUCTOR: Wan Yang
DESCRIPTION: This course is an intro to intermediate level infectious disease mathematical modeling methodological class.  It will introduce the fundamental principles of infectious disease modeling.  Emphasis will be given to compartmental meta-population models.  Over the course, we will learn a variety of mathematical models for infectious diseases, starting from simple compartmental models to more complex compartmental models with various structures, including multiple risk groups, age groups, spatial network, and multiple hosts.  In addition to these models, we will also discuss how key epidemiological parameters (e.g. the basic reproductive number) can be estimated from real disease data.  Other topics will include vaccination/antiviral efficacy assessment, survival analysis, and agent based models.  Half of the course will be devoted to hands-on computer lab excises, using the R Studio open source program (if students are familiar with Python or Matlab, these programs can be used instead).
