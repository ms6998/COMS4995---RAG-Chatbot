TITLE: IMPACT FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABILITY PRACTI
SUBJECT: Sustainability Management
INSTRUCTOR: Bhakti Mirchandani
DESCRIPTION: This survey course examines a range of sustainable and impact investing fixed income and equity products before transitioning to the asset owner perspective on sustainable and impact investing. Each class session includes elements of financial analysis, financial structure, social or environmental impact, and policy and regulatory context. Brief guest lectures, podcasts, and three experiential exercises bring these topics to life. At the end of the course, each student will be able to (i) construct a diversified portfolio of impact investments based on the range of products tackled in class, (ii) integrate ESG into debt and equity valuation, (iii) develop an impact investing product that an asset manager or investment bank could launch, (iv) develop an impact investing strategy for an asset owner, and (v) lead either side of the investor-corporate dialogue on sustainability. The lectures are designed to prepare students for both the impact investing product development exercise and the impact investing asset owner strategy exercise, and these two exercises are designed to prepare students for impact investing leadership over the course of their careers. As an early innovator in social finance, dating back 24 years, the instructor provides students with a practical toolkit, honed by making mainstream financial institutions and products more beneficial to a broader range of stakeholders and making specialist impact investment firms more relevant to and integrated with mainstream markets.
