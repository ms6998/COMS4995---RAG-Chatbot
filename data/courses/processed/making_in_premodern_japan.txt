TITLE: Making in Premodern Japan
SUBJECT: History-east Asian
INSTRUCTOR: Nicolle M Bertozzi
DESCRIPTION: This course introduces students to the world of artisans and makers in premodern Japan from the seventh to the nineteenth century. Broadly, this course is divided into two sections. The first section situates makers within their historical contexts, from the ritsuryō state of ancient Japan to the early modern Tokugawa regime, in order to introduce students to the forms of labor artisans engaged in over the course of premodern history, including corvée labor, guild labor, and free market labor. The second section of the course takes a more thematic approach rooted in fundamental frameworks and ideas in material culture and craft studies. Each week, we will dig into a particular theme or problem, such as embodied knowledge or social marginalization, and think through the ways in which these themes materialized in the specific historical contexts we covered in the first half of the semester.
