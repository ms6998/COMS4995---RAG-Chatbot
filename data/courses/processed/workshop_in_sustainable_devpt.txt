TITLE: WORKSHOP IN SUSTAINABLE DEVPT
SUBJECT: Sustainable Development
INSTRUCTOR: Sharon S Mathews
DESCRIPTION: The upper level undergraduate Sustainable Development Workshop will be modeled on client based graduate-level workshops, but with more time devoted to methods of applied policy analysis and issues in Sustainable Development. The heart of the course is the group project on an issue of sustainable development with a faculty advisor providing guidance and ultimately grading student performance. Students would receive instruction on methodology, group work, communication and the context of policy analysis. Much of the reading in the course would be project-specific and identified by the student research teams. Offered in Fall and Spring.
