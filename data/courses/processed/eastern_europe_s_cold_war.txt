TITLE: EASTERN EUROPE'S COLD WAR
SUBJECT: History
INSTRUCTOR: Elidor Mehilli
DESCRIPTION: This seminar explores the Cold Wars impact on Eastern Europe (1940s-1980s) and Eastern Europes Cold War-era engagements with the wider world. We will address the methodologies used by historians to answer questions like these: What was the Cold War? What did it mean, and for whom? We will also look at the Cold War as something more than a series of events; we will consider its value, uses, and limits as a device for framing the second half of the twentieth century.
