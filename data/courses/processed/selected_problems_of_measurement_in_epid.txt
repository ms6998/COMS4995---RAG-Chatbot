TITLE: Selected Problems of Measurement in Epid
SUBJECT: Epidemiology
INSTRUCTOR: Thelma Mielenz
DESCRIPTION: Research on health outcomes is predicated on investigators’ ability to accurately conceptualize and operationalize health constructs of interest. This course will provide an introduction to basic concepts of measurement theory –classical test and modern —and how they are applied to public health research utilizing health outcomes. Students in this course will learn key elements of applied psychometrics using research examples from the literature and from their own area of interest. In addition to a group project intended to facilitate students’ understanding of the principles presented in lectures, each student will also undertake a measurement project that will enable them to apply this knowledge to their specialized area of research. Students will learn to select and how to collect measures as well as assess the quality of measurement in epidemiologic research.
