TITLE: Economic Policy in the Middle East
SUBJECT: Economics
INSTRUCTOR: Tali Regev
DESCRIPTION: This advanced elective equips economics majors with the tools to analyze the policy challenges and structural dynamics of Middle Eastern economies. Students will apply macroeconomic models and quantitative methods to understand topics such as oil and gas dependence, fiscal sustainability, inflation, trade, labor markets, demographic transition, institutional development, poverty, and the economics of conflict and reform. They will actively research and present case studies that illustrate the policy challenges in specific country settings. Readings are drawn from leading economics textbooks, research articles, policy reports, and multimedia sources, fostering collaboration, critical thinking, and data-driven discussions on contemporary regional development issues while remaining attentive to the human dimension and to the political economy context in which these policies unfold.
