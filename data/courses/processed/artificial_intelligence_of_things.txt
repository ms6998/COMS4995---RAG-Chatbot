TITLE: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OF THINGS
SUBJECT: Applied Analytics
INSTRUCTOR: Javid B Huseynov
DESCRIPTION: Over the past decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed industries by enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and automated control through interconnected devices. Advancements in networking, cloud computing, and robotics have expedited IoT adoption, impacting a wide range of fields from home safety and industrial automation to healthcare and autonomous driving. Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) led to the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), which combines IoT connectivity with AI-driven decision-making to enhance smart systems. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of IoT technologies and their integration with AI and robotic systems. Students will explore IoT architecture, key components, and communication protocols while gaining hands-on experience with IoT platforms, sensors, and data acquisition devices. The curriculum emphasizes practical AIoT applications for real-time decision-making in manufacturing, public safety, smart cities, healthcare, etc., and addresses the ethical considerations of these technologies.
