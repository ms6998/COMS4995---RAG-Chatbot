TITLE: AI USER INTERFACES FOR ANALYTICS
SUBJECT: Applied Analytics
INSTRUCTOR: Javid B Huseynov
DESCRIPTION: In recent years, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have become essential to business intelligence and informed decision making. But to realize the impact of analytics and AI, effective visual communication of data insights via user interfaces (UI), such as web pages and app dashboards, is equally critical. Building effective UIs requires mastering the user experience (UX) design principles and certain front-end development technologies. Furthermore, the recent rise of multimodal Generative AI offers unprecedented opportunities for simplifying, automating, and scaling UX/UI development. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of UX design principles and best practices for developing UIs while emphasizing ethical considerations and inclusivity. Students will learn to create intuitive and visually engaging websites and dashboards that leverage AI-generated insights, also considering data privacy, diversity, and accessibility. Key topics include the design, implementation, and evaluation of UIs, with hands-on experience in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as related cloud services. Students will apply state-of-the-art AI technologies to create intelligent and interactive UIs, all while critically assessing data sources and AI models for potential biases. The course content comprises a blend of conceptual learning and practice assignments. Weekly lectures and reading materials will cover the fundamentals of data visualization and user experience designs. Students will put the gained knowledge into practice through individual design and coding assignments and a group term project.
