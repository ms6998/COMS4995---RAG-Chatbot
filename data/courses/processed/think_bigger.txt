TITLE: Think Bigger
SUBJECT: Management
INSTRUCTOR: Sheena Iyengar
DESCRIPTION: How do we get our best ideas? And, once we have an idea, how do we know if we should pursue it? That’s what the Think Bigger course is about: what it takes to create our best ideas. Over the last decade, modern science—in particular, neuro- and cognitive sciences—have revealed to us how creative ideas develop in the human mind. Here, I present this new knowledge to you as a six-step method called Think Bigger. In every class session, I draw on the relevant science and on many instructive examples to explain the method’s rationale and how it works in practice. We use a workshop format, where every session includes individual in-class exercises, or “creative challenges,” which enable you to develop your skills as an ideator. In addition, all students join a group project, take on an important problem facing our world, and strive to use the six-step method to generate a solution which will be showcased on the last day of class. Think Bigger is a new and unique ideation methodology only offered here at Columbia Business School. It is different from previous mainstream methods of ideation, like Design Thinking. We will use as a textbook a complete draft of Think Bigger, a book by me that will be published in April 2023.
