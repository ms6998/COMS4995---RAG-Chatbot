TITLE: MARKET RESEARCH
SUBJECT: Applied Analytics
INSTRUCTOR: Diahanna L Post
DESCRIPTION: Market research is the way that companies identify, understand and develop the target market for their products.  It is an important component of business strategy, and it draws on the research and analytics skills you have learned thus far in the program. Often market research consists of generating your own data, through quantitative and qualitative methodologies, in pursuit of the market research question. This course is an elective that will expand on quantitative and qualitative methodologies that have been introduced previously, provide an introduction to other methodologies that are more specific to market research, and provide hands-on practice in defining a market research plan from start to finish. Students will also learn about particular types of market research studies and when and how they should be deployed. Students will generate and test their own research instruments. Through the use of case studies and simulations, students will learn how market research fits into an overarching marketing plan for a company. This course is designed for students who have completed the Research Design and Strategy and Analytics core courses, and who are exploring how research fits into product marketing. You will leave this class understanding the essential aspects of market research, when and how they should be deployed, and the role you could play in small and large companies directing and executing on market research opportunities.
