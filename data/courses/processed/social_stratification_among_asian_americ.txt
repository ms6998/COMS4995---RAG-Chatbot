TITLE: Social Stratification Among Asian Americ
SUBJECT: Sociology
INSTRUCTOR: Xi Song
DESCRIPTION: This seminar examines social stratification through the lens of Asian American experiences. Social stratification refers to the unequal distribution of valued resources, such as income, wealth, education, and power, and the processes by which these resources are allocated across individuals, groups, and generations. We will explore how the broader patterns of inequality and mobility in the United States intersect with the histories and social positions of Asian Americans. Topics include income and wealth inequality, educational attainment and occupational mobility, immigration and inter-generational mobility, racialization and stereotypes (e.g., the “model minority" and “perpetual foreigner" narratives), gender and family dynamics, neighborhood segregation, and political and civic incorporation. We will also consider how globalization, transnational migration, and the future of work shape opportunities and constraints for different Asian American communities.
