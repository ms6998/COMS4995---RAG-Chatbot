TITLE: GENERAL CHEMISTRY I-LECTURES
SUBJECT: Chemistry
INSTRUCTOR: Ruben M Savizky
DESCRIPTION: Corequisites: MATH UN1101 Preparation equivalent to one year of high school chemistry is assumed. Students lacking such preparation should plan independent study of chemistry over the summer or take CHEM UN0001 before taking CHEM UN1403. Topics include stoichiometry, states of matter, nuclear properties, electronic structures of atoms, periodic properties, chemical bonding, molecular geometry, introduction to quantum mechanics and atomic theory, introduction to organic and biological chemistry, solid state and materials science, polymer science and macromolecular structures and coordination chemistry. Although CHEM UN1403 and CHEM UN1404 are separate courses, students are expected to take both terms sequentially. The order of presentation of topics may differ from the order presented here, and from year to year. Students must ensure they register for the recitation that corresponds to the lecture section. When registering, please add your name to the wait list for the recitation corresponding to the lecture section (1405 for lecture sec 001; 1407 for lecture sec 002; 1409 for lecture sec 003; 1411 for lecture sec 004).  Information about recitation registration will be sent out before classes begin.  DO NOT EMAIL THE INSTRUCTOR.
