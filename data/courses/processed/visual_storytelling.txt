SUBJECT: School Of Int & Public Affairs
INSTRUCTOR: Christopher Booker
DESCRIPTION: MIA Policy Skills II Core. This course provides students with a foundation in the principles and practices of video journalism and multimedia narrative. Against a backdrop of rapidly evolving platforms, technologies, and generative AI tools, students will learn how to create compelling, credible video content that cuts through the noise of the contemporary media landscape. Led by experienced journalists from PBS NewsHour and the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the class offers a blend of hands-on technical training, theoretical exploration of media production, and critical reflection on the social, ethical, and narrative dimensions of visual communication. Students will produce, film, write, and edit a portfolio of original video stories, using smartphones, digital cameras, and Adobe Premiere. Coursework includes individual and collaborative assignments, culminating in a final video essay project and pitch. In addition to developing technical skills, students will gain experience in story development, audience engagement, and content distribution.
