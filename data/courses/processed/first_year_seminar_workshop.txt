TITLE: FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR WORKSHOP
SUBJECT: First-year Seminar
INSTRUCTOR: Penelope Usher
DESCRIPTION: First-Year Seminars initiate students into the academic life of the College by offering intellectually engaging experiences in which students and faculty from a wide range of home departments work through challenging material, often across disciplinary lines. Each one-semester seminar is designed to develop essential skills for college work, such as the ability to read critically and analytically, to speak clearly and effectively, and to write logically and persuasively. First-Year Seminar Workshops — 4-credit versions of First-Year Seminars—are specially designed for students who believe they would benefit from extra support with their critical reading and academic writing skills. In addition to regular seminar meetings twice per week, students are also required to participate in six Friday “writing labs” over the course of the semester. First-Year Seminar Workshops vary in content.  Descriptions can be found in Vergil.
