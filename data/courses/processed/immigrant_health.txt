DESCRIPTION: Migration is a complex social phenomenon which deeply affects human life. Immigrants face difficulties adjusting to destination environments and are potentially exposed to adverse policies and experiences such as discriminations and stigma, affecting their well-being, regardless of reasons for migration. Understanding migration and its impact on health is important for disease prevention, preserving the health and rights of migrants and assuring the well-being of the communities of which they are a part. This course will identify and analyze the economic, institutional, socio-political and cultural factors affecting the health and well-being of immigrants in the US.  It will assess past and existing policies and programs to ascertain the extent to which they respond(ed) to the needs of the populations. Students will explore structural factors affecting the health of immigrants, and think critically about programs and policies that address important immigration issues.
