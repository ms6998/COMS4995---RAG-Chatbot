TITLE: Freud and Philosophy
SUBJECT: Philosophy
INSTRUCTOR: Francey Russell
DESCRIPTION: In the first half of this course we will read the major works of Freud that make up his “metapsychology.” Metapsychology is psychoanalysis’ “speculative superstructure,” the most philosophical part of psychoanalytic theory, providing a broad theoretical “standpoint” on the mind that is both informed by and guides both empirical research and clinical practice. Freud articulated four metapsychologies (dynamic, economic, topographical, and structural).  The aim will be to read Freud somewhat as we read, for example, Aristotle’s or Kant’s or Nietzsche’s moral psychology.  What are the basic theoretical posits?  What are these claims based on?  From what perspective (first-personal or third-personal) are these claims made?  How does Freud’s picture advance our own practical self-understanding? Etc. In the second half of the course we will read some major responses to Freud in the context of philosophical moral psychology.  So we will read some critical theorists, some engagements with psychoanalytic theory regarding gender and race, and some contemporary analytic philosophers.
