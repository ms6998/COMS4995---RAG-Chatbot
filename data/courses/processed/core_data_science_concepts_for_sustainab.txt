TITLE: Core Data Science Concepts for Sustainab
SUBJECT: Sustainability Management
INSTRUCTOR: Bruce Kahn
DESCRIPTION: The course introduces practitioners of sustainability management to the data analysis techniques and statistical methods which are indispensable to their work. The class teaches how to build statistical substantiation and to critically evaluate it in the context of sustainability problems. The statistics topics and examples have been chosen for their special relevance to sustainability problems, including applications in environmental monitoring, impact assessment, and econometric analyses of sustainable development. Students are assumed to have had no previous exposure to statistics. This course demonstrates how to conduct a quantitative analysis of an organization’s work processes and operations, resource utilization, and environmental impact necessary to create a rationale for implementing sustainability initiatives. Statistical topics, including probability and random variables, will be discussed in both theory and in their practical applications for sustainability managers. This course will provide students with the skills to conduct regression analysis, to conduct hypothesis and estimation testing, to design surveys, and to prepare statistics packages. These quantitative skills are necessary for a professional manager responsible for the management of people, finances and operations toward sustainability goals.
