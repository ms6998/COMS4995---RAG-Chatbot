TITLE: Character Development Lab
SUBJECT: Film
INSTRUCTOR: Trey Ellis
DESCRIPTION: In this seven-week class, open to Writing for Film and Television and Screenwriting & Directing concentrates we will do the deep work of creating at least two unforgettable and irreplaceable characters for a future screen or teleplay. In weekly group meetings, students will be assigned a slot to discuss first a main character and then in response to that character, their main antagonist/foil, working through specific exercises until their two characters are sufficiently rich and nuanced that the writer is now able to build a story around them.
