TITLE: Journal Club in Molecular Epidemiology a
SUBJECT: Environmental Health Sciences
INSTRUCTOR: Greg A Freyer
DESCRIPTION: The primary objectives in this course are to learn to systematically review and summarize primary research in molecular epidemiology and toxicology, to synthesize scientific evidence from both disciplines to establish weight-of-evidence, and to understand how this evidence relates to scientific decision making for improving health outcomes.  In this course, we will evaluate 6 topics in environmental health, each for a 2 week (2 session) block. During the first week of each block, we will review and critique the human and experimental literature separately.  During the second week of each block, we will integrate and synthesize this literature to describe the weight of evidence.  By the end of the semester, students will improve their ability to formulate the weight of scientific evidence about current topics in environmental health and will be able to evaluate how this weight of evidence can inform environmental health decision making.
