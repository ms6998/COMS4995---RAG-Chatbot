TITLE: DOCUMENTARY ACTIVISM:THEORY
SUBJECT: Film
INSTRUCTOR: James L Hoberman
DESCRIPTION: This is a course in how to think about documentary but not about “how to” make documentary work. Its premise is that documentary as an approach is still undergoing revision as a definitional problem. Relevant to our times, cameras and sound recorders are called upon to “witness” events. Basic readings on the history and theory of documentary are the heart of the course and practical exercises test theoretical questions. Students conduct low end exercises with their own smart phone cameras. Topics and issues center on the history of the radical documentary—from the Workers Film and Photo League of the 1930s to the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, comparing then new 16 and 35mm film camera capabilities with contemporary internet distribution. Other topics include climate change and documentary work; motion picture film and photography in labor struggles; uses of anti-war and nuclear bomb footage; sexualities and video camera activism.
