TITLE: Capstone Workshop
SUBJECT: School Of Int & Public Affairs
INSTRUCTOR: Robert Kopech
DESCRIPTION: Prerequisite: Course Application. A Capstone Workshop is a live consulting project with an external client outside of SIPA. Each workshop partners a team of about 6 graduate students with a faculty advisor. The goal is to provide clients with innovative analysis and practical recommendations while SIPA students gain experience by working on a real-world problem. A core requirement for the Master of International Affairs (MIA), Master of Public Administration (MPA), the workshops give students an opportunity to put learning into practice. Serving as their culminating educational experience at SIPA, students work in teams of 6-8 students under the guidance of an expert faculty advisor to work on a real-world consultancy project with an external client. For more information, visit: https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/capstone-workshops.
