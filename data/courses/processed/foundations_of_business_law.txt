TITLE: Foundations of Business Law
SUBJECT: Finance
INSTRUCTOR: Donna M Hitscherich
DESCRIPTION: This course is not a traditional business law survey class. This course is an application-oriented class that provides the business professional with an understanding of certain essential legal concepts that are an integral part of the decision-making process for a business enterprise to operate effectively in the United States. The purpose of this course is to provide the student with a framework that will enable the student to identify legal issues that arise in various circumstances during the operation of a business enterprise. This course will focus primarily on the legal regime in the United States, although the laws of other jurisdictions will be noted where appropriate. The course is highly interactive – legal principles will be imparted as students seek to identify legal issues arising in actual business situations. Daily student class participation is a significant element of the course, accounting for 20% of the student grade.
