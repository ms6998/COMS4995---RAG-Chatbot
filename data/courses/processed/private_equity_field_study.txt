TITLE: Private Equity Field Study
SUBJECT: Finance
INSTRUCTOR: Michael Ewens
DESCRIPTION: The “Private Equity Lab” offers a distinctive experiential learning opportunity for students to engage directly with private equity firms on real-world projects. This course is a blend of academic instruction and hands-on experience, tailored for those looking to deepen their understanding of private equity (PE) through practical application. Partnering with PE firms identified through the Columbia Business School's (CBS) alumni network in the New York City area, this program supports students who work on specific research projects integral to the firms' current deals, portfolio management, or investment strategy. These projects are screened to be mission-crucial but not mission-critical for the firms. This ensures students will work on meaningful projects while protecting the partner firm’s performance.  The course thus facilitates a connection between a student and a PE firm with a self-contained research project that could benefit from the student’s skills. The course aims to coordinate a collection of such projects that would otherwise be organized as “Field Study Projects” in independent studies and seeks to overcome the challenge of students sourcing these opportunities and identifying faculty advisors to mentor the project. Importantly, this is not an internship arrangement, and students are not paid (thus, the hours worked are capped at the usual amount of total expected class time).
