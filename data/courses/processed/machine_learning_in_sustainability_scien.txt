TITLE: Machine Learning in Sustainability Scien
SUBJECT: Sustainability Science
INSTRUCTOR: James L Davis
DESCRIPTION: This course is for students who wish to participate in a hands-on, project-based, exploration of how machine learning (ML) can be harnessed to tackle challenges in sustainability science.  Students will work collaboratively on a semester-long coding project, applying ML techniques to real sustainability problems in data analysis and visualization. Along the way, they will sharpen their skills in AI-assisted coding with tools such as ChatGPT, using these technologies not just to write and debug code more efficiently, but also to enhance creativity, streamline collaboration, and bring complex ideas to life. By the end of the course, students will have experienced the full arc of designing, building, and refining an ML solution with direct relevance to the future of our planet. This course equips students with experience using advanced scientific and computational tools for tackling environmental and sustainability challenges. Through AI-assisted coding of ML solutions, students develop creative approaches to analyzing, modeling, and interpreting state-of-the-art observations of Earth systems using rigorous, quantitative methods. Guided readings and discussion will help students achieve mastery of the subject. The class takes place in a project-based setting where students collaborate on a semester-long project, requiring them to plan together, manage tasks, and integrate diverse skills in applying scientific principles to real-world problems. In doing so, the course not only deepens technical expertise but also strengthens students’ ability to provide data-driven insights that inform sustainability decision-making.
