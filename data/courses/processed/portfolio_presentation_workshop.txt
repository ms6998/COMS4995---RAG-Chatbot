TITLE: Portfolio Presentation Workshop
SUBJECT: Executive Mpa Program
INSTRUCTOR: Kweli E Washington
DESCRIPTION: The Portfolio Presentation Workshop is a culminating course that enables students to synthesize and showcase what they have learned throughout the Executive MPA program. Students develop and present an individual project focused on improving an organization, launching a new initiative, or conducting a case study of a significant policy or management issue. Each student draws upon prior coursework, professional experience, and new research to produce a final written report and two structured presentations. The course emphasizes reflective practice, peer feedback, and real-world application. Students are required to submit a project proposal, assess prior work products, and present findings to their instructor and classmates. Final deliverables demonstrate the student’s ability to apply strategic, analytical, and leadership tools in a way that advances organizational goals and prepares them for future professional growth.
