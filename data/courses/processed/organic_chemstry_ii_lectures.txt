SUBJECT: Chemistry
INSTRUCTOR: Charles E Jr Doubleday
DESCRIPTION: Prerequisites: CHEM UN1404 or CHEM UN1604, CHEM UN1500 and CHEMUN2443. The principles of organic chemistry. The structure and reactivity of organic molecules are examined from the standpoint of modern theories of chemistry. Topics include stereochemistry, reactions of organic molecules, mechanisms of organic reactions, syntheses and degradations of organic molecules, and spectroscopic techniques of structure determination. Although CHEM UN2443 and CHEM UN2444 are separate courses, students are expected to take both terms sequentially. Students must ensure they register for the recitation which corresponds to the lecture section. Please check the Directory of Classes for details.
