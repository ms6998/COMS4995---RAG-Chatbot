TITLE: Fighting Corruption: Concepts and Strate
SUBJECT: Development And Governance
INSTRUCTOR: Richard Nephew
DESCRIPTION: Corruption undermines governance, saps resources and undermines development.  It is also exceptionally difficult to identify, address, and resolve due to the intrinsic opacity of its operative mechanisms, endemic nature inside systems, and persistence. This course will teach: How to identify corruption, both in general and in its particular manifestations; Current strategies to respond to corruption, particularly within developing countries; and, Expected/possible future trends in corruption. This course will also focus on practical problem-solving and policy-making solutions, including through classroom debate, scenario assessment, simulation, and paper-writing.
