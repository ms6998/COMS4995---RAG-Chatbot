TITLE: Special Topics: Nonprofits in Crisis: Le
SUBJECT: Nonprofit Management
INSTRUCTOR: Erwin Vincent S De Leon
DESCRIPTION: In its first few months, the Trump administration has enacted mandates and policies that pose an existential threat to nonprofit organizations, particularly those that serve marginalized groups (i.e., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, immigrants). Anchored on current research on LGBTQ+ organizations, this special topic course explores how nonprofits are resisting the current regime, testing their organizational resiliency, and planning for an uncertain future. In this seminar, students will examine the unique challenges nonprofits face in times of crisis and the crucial role these organizations have played in sustaining communities during pivotal moments in recent history. Students will delve into organizational and leadership resilience and learn the principles and practice of crisis management. This encompasses identifying risks, developing crisis management plans, communicating effectively, and building coalitions. An elective of the M.S. Nonprofit Management program, this course is open to graduate level SPS and Columbia students with a focus on nonprofits and/or civil society. Classes will be highly interactive, centered on discussion of course readings, current events, and students’ personal and professional experience. It will culminate with student presentations based on research on an existing nonprofit that has been impacted by the current administration’s policies.
