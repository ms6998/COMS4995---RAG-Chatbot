TITLE: TOPICS IN MUSIC & SOCIETY
SUBJECT: Music
INSTRUCTOR: Aaron A Fox
DESCRIPTION: This course seeks to approach the study of music and society by comparatively studying repertories from different parts of the world, how the history of ideas and methods of studying such repertoires shaped them, the practices that constitute them and the ways they are understood and used by different peoples. Central to this course is the interrelationship between the constitution of a repertoire and the history of the construction of knowledge about it.
