TITLE: Topics in Organizational Economics
SUBJECT: Economics
INSTRUCTOR: Cristobal Otero Ruiz-Tagle
DESCRIPTION: This course introduces the students to the ﬁeld of Organizational Economics. We combine theoretical and empirical methods to study the nature, design, and performance of organizations. Organizations, such as ﬁrms, bureaucracies, and political parties, live in a second-best world, where ineﬃciencies are inevitable. Our goal is to understand and measure these ineﬃciencies, study their causes and how to minimize them. This course is divided in two parts of equal length. The ﬁrst part introduces a few of the main theoretical models and ﬁndings from the organizational-economics literature. The second part focuses on how to bring the models to the data. By design, the course is intended for a broad set of students: those who are theoretically inclined, those who are empirically inclined, and those who are both. Many of the tools and skills that are developed in this course will be useful not only within organizational economics but, more broadly, to other ﬁelds such as industrial organization, political economy, development economics. Our ultimate goal is to accelerate the students' transition toward conducting their own independent research.
