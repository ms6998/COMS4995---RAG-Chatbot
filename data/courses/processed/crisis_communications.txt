DESCRIPTION: MIA & MPA Leadership and Management II Core. This course blends crisis communication theory, case studies, and immersive simulations to prepare students for high-stakes communications challenges in the public and nonprofit sectors. Students will develop strategic judgment and tactical skills necessary to lead during crises while practicing rapid-response communication under pressure. Topics include defining and diagnosing crises, designing messaging strategies, working with the media, coordinating across agencies, and maintaining public trust. The course also explores the role of tone and humor, legal considerations, and the dynamics of internal and external communication during emergencies. Students will engage in hands-on simulations replicating real-world crises, such as natural disasters, viral incidents, and organizational failures. Through weekly assignments and scenario-based exercises, students will gain experience developing crisis memos, talking points, and live-response strategies.
