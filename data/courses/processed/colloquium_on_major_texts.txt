TITLE: COLLOQUIUM ON MAJOR TEXTS
SUBJECT: Asian Humanities
INSTRUCTOR: Gavin Healy
DESCRIPTION: This course explores the core classical literature in Chinese, Japanese and Korean Humanities. The main objective of the course is to discover the meanings that these literature offer, not just for the original audience or for the respective cultures, but for us. As such, it is not a survey or a lecture-based course. Rather than being taught what meanings are to be derived from the texts, we explore meanings together, informed by in-depth reading and thorough ongoing discussion.
