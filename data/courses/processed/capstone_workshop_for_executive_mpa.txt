TITLE: Capstone Workshop for Executive MPA
SUBJECT: Executive Mpa Program
INSTRUCTOR: Robert Kopech
DESCRIPTION: The EMPA Capstone Workshop is a culminating experience in which students apply the practical skills and analytical knowledge acquired during the program to a real-world policy or management challenge. Working in small consulting teams under faculty supervision, students engage with an external client to address a defined problem, conduct research, and deliver actionable recommendations. Each team produces a final written report and presents its findings in a formal oral briefing designed to support implementation and impact. The workshop develops applied consulting, project management, and client engagement skills while reinforcing core competencies in policy analysis and public leadership. Completion of the Capstone or Portfolio Presentation Workshop is a graduation requirement for Executive MPA students and is typically taken in the final semester. Enrollment is by application and managed by the EMPA Student Affairs.
