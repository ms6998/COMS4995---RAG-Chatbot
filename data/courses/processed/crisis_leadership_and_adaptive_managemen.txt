DESCRIPTION: MIA & MPA Leadership and Management II Core. This course equips students with the skills, strategies, and resilience necessary to lead effectively during extreme events and complex crises. Drawing on case studies, personal narratives, and interactive exercises, the course examines how crises —ranging from natural disasters and terrorist attacks to cyber incidents and pandemics —require adaptive management and decisive leadership under intense pressure. Students will examine the multiple forces that shape crisis response, including social, cognitive, operational, and political dynamics. The course provides a framework for assessing risk, coordinating cross-sector efforts, developing crisis communication strategies, and fostering innovation in fast-evolving situations.
