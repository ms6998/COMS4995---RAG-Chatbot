TITLE: Science of Well-Being and Human Potentia
SUBJECT: Psychology
INSTRUCTOR: Scott B Kaufman
DESCRIPTION: What does it mean to reach your full potential? Can science inform how you can live your own best life? The main mission of this seminar is to provide an up-to-date understanding of theoretical, empirical, and applied advances in the science of well-being and human potential. Consideration will be given to conflicting viewpoints and their respective empirical support. The course is grounded in the core principles of humanistic psychology, and will cover essential human needs, including security, growth, mindfulness, connection, self-esteem, love, creativity, character, resiliency, purpose, flow, gratitude, awe, and other forms of transcendence. We will also cover the latest science of human performance, including the development of intelligence, talent, and creativity. Throughout this seminar you will engage in experiential learning and practical exercises to further help you nurture what’s best within you— and become a whole person — which will inform our theoretical and empirical understanding of the latest scientific findings. My hope is that in addition to enhancing your appreciation of how the scientific method can increase your understanding of human potential more generally, the exercises and readings in this course will also help you in your own personal journey to realize your greatest strengths and become more fully human— accepting and becoming flexible with the totality of who you are, so that you can become the person you most want to become.
