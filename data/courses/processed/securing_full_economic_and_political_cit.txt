TITLE: Securing Full Economic and Political Cit
SUBJECT: Urban & Social Policy
INSTRUCTOR: Verna Eggleston
DESCRIPTION: This course explores how federal, state, and local policies shape access to full economic and political citizenship in the United States. Students will examine the role of public institutions, legislation, and informal influencers in shaping opportunities for historically marginalized communities. Drawing on case studies and core texts such as The Persuaders by Anand Giridharadas, the course considers the relationship between economic self-sufficiency and civic participation. Topics include federal disaster response, social benefit structures, voting rights, and the role of modern-day persuaders in policy discourse. Through discussion and applied assignments, students will analyze policy frameworks and propose actionable strategies to expand civic and economic inclusion.
