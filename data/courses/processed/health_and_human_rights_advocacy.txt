TITLE: Health and Human Rights Advocacy
SUBJECT: Population & Family Health
INSTRUCTOR: Marta L Schaaf
DESCRIPTION: The class explores how laws, policies, and rights function to shape public health, with particular emphasis on the implications of this interaction for rights-based approaches to health programs and policy. After introducing the principles, practices, and underlying assumptions of law, policy, and rights, the class offers students the opportunity to use human rights tools in documentation of health-related human rights violations and formulating programs, policy responses, and advocacy strategies to violations. A wide range of issues - sexual and reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS, health problems of criminalized populations, the intersection of the environment and health, and others - are explored to illustrate the importance of sustained human rights inquiry and analysis in public health.
