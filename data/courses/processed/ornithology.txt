TITLE: Ornithology
SUBJECT: Biology
INSTRUCTOR: Rafael Marcondes
DESCRIPTION: You saw a bird today. You saw a bird yesterday. You will surely see a bird tomorrow. Without knowing you, or knowing what you do with your days, I know this for a fact about you. Unless they are under absolute confinement, chances are that every human being anywhere on the planet will see at least one bird every day. Birds are everywhere. They are mostly diurnal, they fly and they vocalize. Probably more so than any other kind of animal, this makes birds particularly conspicuous and appealing to humans. But when you saw a bird today, did you really see it? Did it register at all? Probably not—no more than a passing car or cloud or a stranger in the sidewalk. That’s a shame, because birds have shaped modern biology more than any other group, inspiring discoveries in ecology, evolution, and behavior. They also move billions of dollars each year through birdwatching. The overarching goal of this class is for you to start really seeing birds for the wondrous animals that they are and all that they have taught us about biology. This will include identifying and naming bird species, having the basic vocabulary to talk about birds, and relating your bird observations in the field to conceptual knowledge about their evolution and ecology. Towards that goal, students will participate in a combination of lectures, readings, group discussions, written assignments, and group and solo outings to observe birds in Central Park. Topics addressed will include: evolutionary origins of birds; bird systematics and classification; the biology of feathers; bioacoustics and birdsong; the biology of migration; bird reproductive behavior; and bird conservation.
