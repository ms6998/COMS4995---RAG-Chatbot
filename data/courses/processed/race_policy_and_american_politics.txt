TITLE: Race Policy and American Politics
SUBJECT: Urban & Social Policy
INSTRUCTOR: Christina M Greer
DESCRIPTION: This course explores the complex and enduring relationship between race and American politics. Since the founding of the United States, political institutions have shaped evolving definitions of race, and racial inequality has remained a persistent feature of American society. As a result, race and politics remain inextricably linked. The course examines how racial disparities—and efforts to address them—affect local, state, and national political dynamics. Drawing frequently on examples from New York City, students will analyze intergroup relations among Black, white, Latino, and Asian communities, as well as the causes and consequences of contemporary racial mobilization. The course will also address the influence of executive leadership, including the ongoing impact of the Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies on racial discourse and governance. Students will begin with a historical overview of race as an organizing concept, then turn to contemporary themes such as inequality, governance, and the role of institutions in perpetuating or challenging systemic disparities. Topics include disenfranchisement, gentrification, civil rights, economic mobility, and spatial access. The course engages a range of policy areas, including education, immigration, housing, health, elections, poverty, political representation, transportation, and criminal justice. These will be considered in relation to party politics, group identity, coalition building, and intergroup conflict, with attention to both change and continuity in the intersection of race and American public life. Guiding questions include: What role does collective racial identity play in shaping policy demands? Should race-based policymaking continue at the local, national, or international level? What lessons can be drawn from coalition politics in New York City and beyond? And what does meaningful political change look like in the twenty-first century United States?
