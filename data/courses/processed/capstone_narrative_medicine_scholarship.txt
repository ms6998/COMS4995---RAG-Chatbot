TITLE: CAPSTONE: NARRATIVE MEDICINE SCHOLARSHIP
SUBJECT: Narrative Medicine
INSTRUCTOR: Danielle R Spencer
DESCRIPTION: The Narrative Medicine Scholarship Capstone advances students’ scholarly writing on a topic of their choosing in a dynamic collaborative working group setting. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, there are a range of subjects, methodological approaches, and writing styles, and we will discuss the best approach to to each paper. We can take up participants’ manuscripts at any stage of the writing process—from scratch, or a paper from another course or context that you’d like to develop further. You do not have to have a set idea of which writing project you wish to develop in advance; we can brainstorm together. All students will give and receive constructive feedback to one another, and all students will receive instructor suggestions/comments/edits throughout the semester as well.
