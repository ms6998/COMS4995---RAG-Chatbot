TITLE: DIGITAL PRODUCT INNOVATION & ENTREPRENEU
SUBJECT: Information & Knowledge Strat
INSTRUCTOR: Ralph Poole
DESCRIPTION: Digital Product Innovation and Entrepreneurship aims to provide students with the knowledge and expertise in innovation and new product development required to create, test, and launch a new digital product. In this course, students will undertake the following: perform a competitive analysis, investigate novel knowledge-based digital products, gather user requirements, validate the feasibility of proposed products, devise a go-to-market strategy, construct a financial plan, develop a high-fidelity digital product prototype, and pitch their business idea to a panel of venture capitalists. Students can expect to engage in a fast-paced, rigorously hands-on curriculum focused on developing a pre-revenue business. The exponential increase in data and information, coupled with the combination of increasingly potent analytics and natural language processing platforms, AI, and LLMs, provides entrepreneurs with tremendous opportunities to bring innovative, customer-focused digital products to market. While there are no direct paths to bring a new product idea to market successfully, the application of the lean startup methodology provides a well-tested path from idea to profit.
