TITLE: Internet Governance and Human Rights
SUBJECT: Technology Policy & Innovation
INSTRUCTOR: Peter Micek
DESCRIPTION: Whoever controls the future of the internet controls the future of the world. This course explores the institutions, stakeholder groups, and policy debates that shape how the internet is built, maintained, and governed. It examines the internet’s technical roots and the people and entities—telecom companies and their regulators, technologists and idealists, security forces and hackers—who shape its evolution today. Students will study the basic workings of internet and mobile networks, the national and global forums where internet policy is made, and how digital regulation affects people, rights, cultures, and economies. Class sessions combine lectures, group discussions, guest speakers, and hands-on simulations to explore real-world tensions between national sovereignty and borderless cyberspace, corporate responsibility and civil liberties, and differing digital norms across regions. The international human rights framework is presented as a foundation for policymaking in the digital age. Course topics include intermediary liability, domain name systems, surveillance, privacy, net neutrality, AI, disinformation, digital identity, and internet shutdowns. Students will write a reflection paper, a midterm policy memo, and a final policy brief, and participate in a group-led in-class “Event” designed to bring readings to life through role play and stakeholder engagement. Participation is essential.
