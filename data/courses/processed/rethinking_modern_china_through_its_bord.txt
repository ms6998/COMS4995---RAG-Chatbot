TITLE: Rethinking Modern China Through Its Bord
SUBJECT: History-east Asian
INSTRUCTOR: Palden Gyal Palden
DESCRIPTION: This seminar examines the history of modern China through its borderlands, exploring how Qing imperial conquests, subsequent colonial expansion, and state-building shaped the contemporary territory and population of China. Focusing on Tibet, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan (Xinjiang), and Taiwan in the 20th century, the course critically examines the violent processes of colonial expansion that underpinned China’s transformation from a multiethnic empire into the nation-state of the People’s Republic of China.
