TITLE: Smart Agriculture for a Changing Climate
SUBJECT: Sustainability Management
INSTRUCTOR: Henry A Gordon-Smith
DESCRIPTION: Agriculture is highly dependent on stable climate conditions to produce the world’s food with sufficient nutritional quality at an affordable cost. Climate change is threatening the breadbaskets of the world with shifting rainfall, pests, and weather patterns. Farmers face enormous challenges in adapting to this volatility that is affecting their livelihoods and communities locally, and threatens the global food systems stability. Adaptation to these changes has become a high priority for policy makers, corporations, and investors around the world. Climate smart agriculture presents solutions to the existential threat to the global food supply by utilizing a range of tech enabled methods for producing more food with less resources. The challenge is daunting because there is no “one size fits all” solution. Instead, localized solutions that meet the social, environmental, and economic realities of farmers need to be developed, accelerated, and implemented.
