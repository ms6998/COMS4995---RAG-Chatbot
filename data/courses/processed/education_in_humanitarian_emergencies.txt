TITLE: Education in Humanitarian Emergencies
SUBJECT: Development And Governance
INSTRUCTOR: 
DESCRIPTION: Education is often the first casualty of crisis—and the cornerstone of recovery. This course examines how education systems sustain continuity of learning amid conflict, displacement, and climate-related shocks. As crises intensify worldwide, understanding how to keep children learning under disruption has become one of the defining challenges of our generation. Students analyze the principles and practice of Education in Emergencies (EiE), including the legal and policy frameworks that protect the right to learn, the minimum standards guiding education responses, and coordination and financing within the evolving global aid architecture. Cross-cutting barriers—gender inequality, gender-based violence, early marriage, child recruitment, and disability inclusion—are addressed throughout.  Students will explore how education can drive equity, peacebuilding, and climate resilience in crisis contexts, gaining the analytical and practical tools to design and lead responses in global organizations. Methods include case studies, simulations, and interactive sessions with humanitarian leaders. Applied projects may focus on aid and finance, emergency response, policy design, or education system resilience, or other topics of interest for students, supporting clear pathways to professional impact.
