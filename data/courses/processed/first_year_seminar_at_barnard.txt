TITLE: FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR AT BARNARD
SUBJECT: First-year Seminar
INSTRUCTOR: Samuel Davis
DESCRIPTION: First-Year Seminars initiate students into the academic life of the College by offering intellectually engaging experiences in which students and faculty from a wide range of home departments work through challenging material, often across disciplinary lines. Each one-semester seminar is designed to develop essential skills for college work, such as the ability to read critically and analytically, to speak clearly and effectively, and to write logically and persuasively. First-Year Seminars vary in content and format, and fall into two categories: Special Topics and Reacting to the Past.   Descriptions are available in Vergil.
