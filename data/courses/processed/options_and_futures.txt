TITLE: OPTIONS AND FUTURES
SUBJECT: Prof. Studies Management
INSTRUCTOR: Ted Jastrzebski
DESCRIPTION: The course seeks to familiarize students with the basic derivatives (futures and options contracts).  Both have played a role in the markets for many-many years (before the emergence of modern derivative markets in the 70s).  Following the beginning of standardization at CBOE (1973) we have witnessed a dramatic growth in options markets and options are now traded on many exchanges around the world (CBOE, PHLX, NYSE etc.) Huge volumes of options are also traded over the counter (OTC), particularly on foreign exchange and interest rates.  Many options are traded daily in the markets on a wide array of underlying assets from commodities to financial instruments (stocks, bonds, indexes, currencies, futures etc.) to… weather! The appearance of exotic options has driven volumes even higher in the OTC market providing investors with even wider possibilities for customizing risks borne and hedging against risks.
