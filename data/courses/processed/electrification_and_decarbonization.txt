TITLE: Electrification and Decarbonization
SUBJECT: Sustainability Management
INSTRUCTOR: Rory Christian
DESCRIPTION: Electricity is the lifeblood of human society. Decarbonization of global economies through electrification is seen as the most viable path for reducing GHG emissions and addressing the worst effects of climate change. Though generally accepted as the best path forward, an understanding of the operational parameters of the electric system is essential to understanding both the benefits and limitations of current and future actions. This includes the highly visible investments in renewable energy generation, less visible but equally important investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the largely personal, private choices of individual households and businesses. The course will examine pathways for the transition from fossil fuel-based electricity generation to one dominated by electricity generated by renewable energy. Students will examine the drivers of past energy transitions and various factors influencing current energy systems. At the conclusion of the course, students will be able understand the drivers of past energy transitions, the impact of those drivers on the overall energy supply chain, and how new technologies (e.g. distributed energy resources, smart meters, internet of things (IOT), etc.), consumer adoption of mass market products (e.g. Electric Vehicles, battery backup, etc,) and evolving consumer expectations (e.g. fast charging) are altering long held assumptions about energy production and use. Through this work, students will be able to infer practical steps to support current efforts to decarbonize and the potential impacts of those actions on the modern energy supply chain.
