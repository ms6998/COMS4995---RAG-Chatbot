INSTRUCTOR: Yashodhan Kanoria
DESCRIPTION: This course will cover some of the fundamental product decisions together with the basic analytic and data science tools to support them that are currently being used to run the most exciting online marketplaces in the world. More specifically, among others, we will address the following questions: How does Uber or Lyft match drivers to passengers? How does Airbnb select the set of listings to show to a guest in a search? How can we build an algorithmic, scalable reputation and trust system in an e-commerce platform such as Amazon? How should advertisers optimize their decisions in today’s online advertising marketplaces run by Google and others? Verticals of interest include the following: • Matching platforms like those for ride-hailing, lodging, dating, labor, and food delivery. • Internet advertising platforms including search engine advertising, display advertising, and sponsored products. • Retail platforms including those for physical goods like Amazon, Etsy, and possibly also those for virtual goods like the App Store/Play Store and gaming platforms.
