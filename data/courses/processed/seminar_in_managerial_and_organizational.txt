TITLE: Seminar in Managerial and Organizational
SUBJECT: Public Health
INSTRUCTOR: 
DESCRIPTION: Leading health systems that promote population health and deliver high-quality yet efficient health care is a national and global priority. Health systems must learn to improve and innovate, and leaders at the helm of these systems must navigate change and complexity. As future leaders, you will be central to influencing these systems, whether from a position of formal or informal authority. Today, leading health systems effectively requires self-awareness, as well as an understanding of how people and groups behave in organizations. The context in which you work – public health, global health, or health care- presents special challenges and opportunities. This course is designed to give DrPH students a strong foundation in the managerial and organizational behavior issues associated with leading health systems. The course aims to build management, teamwork, and interpersonal skills that may be put into practice. Concepts from the discipline of managerial and organizational behavior (MOB) will be used as a lens to interpret and understand current health system issues. Students should complete the course with an appreciation of the unique organizational and interpersonal aspects of their context, and with the capacity to understand their unique value to solving some of our most pressing health challenges. The course is designed to allow students to reflect on and apply lessons drawn from personal leadership experience in health systems.
