TITLE: Investing in Social Ventures
SUBJECT: Finance
INSTRUCTOR: Jonathan Mokrauer
DESCRIPTION: This half semester course provides students with the opportunity to perform due diligence on early-stage social ventures (nonprofit and for-profit ventures with a social or environmental mission). This course is designed for MBA students interested in impact investing, social entrepreneurship, or philanthropy. The objective of the course is for students to learn both the theory of investing in early-stage social ventures and the practice of evaluating early-stage social ventures through a due diligence process. This course is not designed for the evaluation of larger, well-established social enterprises. Students are placed in teams to evaluate social entrepreneurs from the Columbia University community who have applied for funding from the Tamer Fund for Social Ventures. The course is a combination of in-class lectures and discussion, and practical application of class lessons outside of the classroom. Major topics covered include: the due diligence process, assessing venture pitches and teams, due diligence in emerging markets, due diligence of non-profits, impact measurement and management, and valuations and deal structure. During the course, each student team completes detailed due diligence on their assigned social venture, including diligence on applicants, the social venture and the sector. The course concludes with student teams submitting a written due diligence report and a recommendation for funding to the Investment Board of the Tamer Fund for Social Ventures.
