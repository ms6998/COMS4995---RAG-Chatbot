TITLE: Beyond the Boardroom: the Power of Smart
SUBJECT: Finance
INSTRUCTOR: Daniel Wolfenzon
DESCRIPTION: Most companies around the world are controlled by one or more large shareholders. These shareholders—whether founders and their families, private equity firms, activist investors, or institutional stakeholders—play a central role in their firms’ governance, actively shaping corporate decisions and oversight structures. Their involvement in the firm creates room for the board to serve not only as a monitoring body but also as a crucial source of strategic guidance and expertise.
