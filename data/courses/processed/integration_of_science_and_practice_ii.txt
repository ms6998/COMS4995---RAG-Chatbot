TITLE: INTEGRATION OF SCIENCE AND PRACTICE II
SUBJECT: Public Health
INSTRUCTOR: Marlyn M Delva
DESCRIPTION: The different studios in the Mailman Core teach a set of foundational perspectives, knowledge, and skills. But the practice of public health requires applying this education in a context characterized by uncertainty, risk, competing interests, and conflicting values. In the fall semester, Integration of Science and Practice (ISP) involved contained cases where the stories and evidence were organized and arranged for us. Often the decision-points were relatively unambiguous. This spring we will expand our reach, taking on cases in a way that looks more like the real world. We will start with a complex case specifically selected to integrate key concepts from the Core Semester. You will write a policy memo by focusing in on an issue within the case that you find compelling. The policy memo will serve as a model for you to then construct your own cases in small groups and take responsibility for teaching an ISP session devoted to your case. This team-based approach to problem-solving will also allow you to bring the concepts you explore in Leadership and Development to bear in ISP. These student-led cases, drawing on a range of skills and tools, represent the culmination of the Core.
