TITLE: Realizing Global LGBTI Health and Human
SUBJECT: Population & Family Health
INSTRUCTOR: Kent Klindera
DESCRIPTION: The global movement to realize lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) rights has both gained traction and faced significant pushback in recent years: although global normative and legal frameworks have evolved in some ways to recognize the rights of sexual and gender minorities, LGBTI people around the world are experiencing progress, setbacks, and scapegoating.  The course will apply concepts of equity, access, inclusion, and human rights to interrogate how and why sexual and gender minorities are often excluded from humanitarian and development interventions despite the compounding oppressions that they face. Drawing upon the practice of public health and human rights work from humanitarian crises and low- and middle-income countries around the world, this course will explore how practitioners and advocates can best understand the evolution of LGBTI human rights in a variety of contexts; students will also probe how to become effective and supportive partners and allies to grassroots movements and organizations. Through a series of case studies, students will examine how LGBTI people are challenging the gender binary in societies around the world, including biases inherent in the structures of humanitarian and development work, and how such activists, advocates, and artists are mobilizing to ensure their inclusion in decision-making fora and their access to health and other services.  Students will also consider and develop strategies to support local activists in these movements; these activists embody the intrinsic vulnerability of being sexual and gender minorities in countries where those identities are criminalized, the courage of those determined to change their societies, and the cunning to seize upon the societal jolts that humanitarian and development work can, sometimes, provide.
